# Automated-System-for-Sterlizing-Surgical-Tools

This is the python code for a project that took place in the Winter 2021 semester. This Python script controls the simulation of an autoclave system, using a robotic arm equipped with grippers to handle containers. The purpose of the simulation is to model the process of moving containers to and from autoclaves for sterilization.

## Code Overview:

The code defines functions for various actions, such as moving the arm to specific locations, picking up and releasing containers, and interacting with autoclaves.
Containers are identified by an ID, and the simulation involves picking up containers, moving them to autoclave locations, sterilizing them, and then releasing them.
The simulation can be repeated based on user input (flexing the left arm muscle sensor).


## Note:

This code is designed for simulation purposes and will require integration with a robotic arm simulator for practical implementation.
